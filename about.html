      <h1>About Johannes</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        My name is <strong>Johannes Wikner</strong>, founder of <strong>The Swilderness Family</strong> – a Swedish family adventure project
        focused on outdoor life, nature experiences and a more active, present way of living together as a family.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was born in Mölndal, Sweden, and spent my early childhood in the Gothenburg area before moving to Kungsbacka, where I have lived most of my life.
        Growing up, I spent more time outdoors than in front of screens – building shelters, crafting bows, fishing and learning early on how to solve
        problems using whatever was available.
      </p>

      <h2>Work, responsibility and entrepreneurship</h2>
      <p>
        In 2009 I started working as a carpenter with no prior experience. It quickly became a hands-on education in responsibility, craftsmanship and work ethic.
        By working for several different companies I gained broad experience in residential construction, which eventually led me to start my first company in 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entrepreneurship became a long journey filled with both successes and hard lessons. Over time the business evolved, and in 2022 it shifted toward e-commerce
        and digital sales. Working with websites, marketing and business development sparked a growing interest in content, communication and how to build something
        sustainable in the digital space. In 2024 the company was closed after several demanding years, and the experience continues to shape how I approach my work today.
      </p>

      <h2>Returning to nature</h2>
      <p>
        My childhood connection to nature faded during my teenage years, but was reignited in 2018 when I picked up an old fly-fishing rod and stepped back into
        flowing water. That moment marked the beginning of a renewed relationship with nature that has only grown stronger since.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outdoor life, fishing, hiking and simple camp living became a way to both slow down and challenge myself. Over time a new idea emerged: why not document
        these experiences – not as perfect postcards, but as real, honest moments?
      </p>

      <h2>The Swilderness Family</h2>
      <p>
        The idea for <strong>The Swilderness Family</strong> was born during a family trip to Skrea Camping. What started as a way to document our adventures soon
        grew into a larger project. The first video was published in January 2025, and since then the channel has expanded across YouTube, TikTok, Instagram and
        the website <a href="https://swilderness.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swilderness.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is driven by curiosity, learning and long-term thinking. The goal has never been quick results or overnight success, but to gradually build
        content that feels genuine, useful and inspiring.
      </p>

      <h2>Family at the core</h2>
      <p>
        My partner Rosita and our son Leo are a natural part of both life and content. Watching Leo discover nature for the first time, face new environments and
        overcome challenges is a major source of motivation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to show that adventures don’t have to be extreme, expensive or perfect. What matters is the willingness to try, adapt and keep going when things
        become difficult. Many of our trips include unexpected challenges – weather changes, tired legs or altered plans – and that’s often where the strongest
        memories are created.
      </p>

      <h2>What I do today</h2>
      <p>
        Today, The Swilderness Family is a passion project that I run alongside exploring future professional opportunities. My work includes content creation in
        video and photography, website publishing, basic SEO and storytelling. It’s a process of continuous learning, where each project contributes to both
        personal and professional growth.
      </p>

      <h2>Values and motivation</h2>
      <p>
        Everything I create is grounded in authenticity, responsibility and integrity. I don’t produce content purely for attention, and I don’t compromise on
        what I stand for. For me, growth isn’t about comparing myself to others, but about becoming slightly better today than yesterday – as a person, a parent
        and a creator.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hope is that those who follow our journey feel inspired, curious and encouraged to head out on their own adventures – big or small.
      </p>
